-------------------- Hard Drive Notes-------------------- 
Heavily advanced the pink marked odroid with the pink drive
until the kernel update for the wifi to work 

Once the Wifi worked made a copy, good thing because the USB ports all
stopped working on the pink drive.

Copied the backup back to the pink drive. Started developing on the 
plain drive which had broken packages. Reverted the kernel expecting 
the to fix the wifi but break the packages but both worked! 


Feb 11th.
Made a copy of the plain drive to the pink.


-------------------- Odroid Notes-------------------- 
Pink Odroid originally used a lot with the arduinos and I2C connections.
GPIO ports definitely work on the pink, might need to check the plain.
