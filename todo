On this computer:

	publishing map and ways efficiently (updating visible marks)
		create a function that converts vec<EndPoint> to MarkerArray
		easily adjust visible points
		set publishing frequency

	publish odom location at a certain rate
		save driveloop rate as variable
		have a counter increment + do math to publish at slower rate
		set flag for separate publishing thread

	plan out thread count?
		driveLoop - does motor PID, odom calculations
		lidarUpdateLoop - refine location, kalman filter?
				  variable time depending on good reading
		mainCommandSequence - main logic 
		sensorLoop - run prior to starting and kill when mic triggers?
	

------------------------------ DONE + NOTES ------------------------------

	odom() calculations
		Eigen is breaking w/ size issues
		THIS ISN'T MATLAB (arrays start at 1)

ynamic reconfigure (went away with kernel update for wifi but restored after downgrade which left the wifi working? not complaining)


Get wifi working:
		main problem: modprobe rtl8192cu_common fails
		use lsmod to see all kernel modules
		following this github fix:
		https://github.com/pvaret/rtl8192cu-fixes.git
		installing the fixes is failing (dkms error)
this was fixed by upgrading the kernel which then broke other things and was downgraded later.

	see kernels with dpkg --list | grep linux-image
	add eigen and start odom coding

	kernels at locations:
	/lib/modules/<kernels>
	/usr/src/

	fixed the not found image error by symlinking
	sudo ln -s /usr/src/linux-headers-$(uname -r) /lib/modules/4.14.5-92/build




figure out why path between 4 and 10 doesn't work
run all possible combinations for finding a path (make sure all work)

 Make room reconfigure functions (upper and lower) edit waypoint neighbor connections

Get SSH setup on Odroid
working - just check the IP beforehand
