figure out why path between 4 and 10 doesn't work
run all possible combinations for finding a path (make sure all work)

1. Make room reconfigure funcitions (upper and lower) edit waypoint neighbor connections
2. Test findPath()
3. Program Arduino to take motor power inputs (also setup all Arduino pin connections)
4. Program Arduino to output encoder values (do odometry math on Odroid or Arduino??)
	if on Odroid 
		check update rates (needs to be very fast)

	if on Arduino
		Odroid needs to be able to send location updates based on LIDAR

5. Get SSH setup on Odroid
6.
